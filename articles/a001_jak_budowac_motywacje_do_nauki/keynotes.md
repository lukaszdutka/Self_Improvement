# Keypoints for kickoffs

> Find value in both short and long term. What could you do if you knew those things?

> Join with plans or dreams. It helps you to become who?

> Will this increase my competences?

> How I want to learn it? From book, talking, make presentation, other?

> Prepare materials. Is it relevant to the goal?

> Divide into smaller chunks. 

> Set smaller chunks in time with some deadline. Remember about rest, emergency and repetition days.
> Assign specific date to specific chunk/chunks of knowledge.

# Keypoints for process

> Learn to learn something, not to pass exams.

> Judge the progress.

> Active repetition! Reach to long-memory.

> Create notes, flashcards and open questions.

> Every chunk of knowledge and every repetition is small success. Celebrate.

> Breaks and good sleep are vital. 

> Set phone to airplane mode, close unnecessary programs. Quiet music without lyrics.

> Ask relatives for support ("I am going to learn, please do not disturb me" kind of thing)

> Have everything important in reach

> Feedback. Try use knowledge in real life or talk about it with somebody who knows it.

# Summary

We should not read in order to pass some exam, but to learn something.  
Build motivation, not have it or find it.

There are many factors that can influence our motivation and they fall in three categories:  

### Seeing value
Seeing personal value in accomplishing the goal. It can be feel of 
overall rise of competence, learning something practical and applicable in life or just
to satisfy the curiosity.

### Sense of effectiveness
It is a sense (sensation?) that your knowledge level is high enough
to understand new part of knowledge.

### Environment factor
All other factors that have direct or indirect impact on our learning sessions.
Not every of them are dependent to us.  
Do we learn alone or in group?  
Do we use quiet place or we use public places?  
Do our surrounding people (partner, parents, friends) encourage us or pull to the bottom?  

Now we can think how to achieve those three categories. 

### Seeing value - how?
1. Find value in both short and long term. What could you do if you knew those things? 
Write it down.
2. Join this task with your plans or dreams. It helps you to become who?
3. Make sure that this thing you want to learn will increase your competences. 
Ask yourself: Will I feel that I learned something new? 
Compare yourself to yourself from yesterday.
4. You can learn something in many different ways. Alone or with someone, 
book or lectures, etc. 

### Sense of effectiveness - how?
In order to increase sense of our effectiveness to learn we can use effective 
learning techniques.
There are couple of groups:  
#### Selection of materials
1. ALWAYS Try to define your level of competence. Do not be afraid. 
In order to draw a road to the goal, you also need to know where you start :)  
By this way you will know how to tackle the problem and there the chance 
that you create an achievable plan will be bigger. And if the material will turn out to
be hard, it will not scare or surprise you - and there will be no decrease of motivation.
2. Check if the materials you want to use to learn are relevant to the goal.
Before you start the learning process - prepare all of the materials. Ask somebody
who is already there if this is a good way.
#### Plan your learning sessions
1. ALWAYS divide your material to smaller chunks. It will be easier to estimate 
the effort and better for your motivation. Try not to finish your learning sessions in the
middle of a chunk.
2. Create a plan based on deadline. Include rest and emergency days - first for rest, 
second for catching up in case of... emergency :P
3. Your plan should include days for repetition. The number of repetition days should 
be at least as big as the number of learning days. Repetitions are vital
4. Do not to change the plan. NEVER... or only if some unexpected random event
 absorbs you for a few days.
#### Systematization and organization of knowledge
1. Create graphical representation of the topic. It can be a diagram, table or mind map.
It will increase your awareness of whole topic and during learning you will see how those
small chunks of knowledge are filling up the diagram.
2. In order to systematize the knowledge you need to test yourself. The best way to do this
is active repetition - so every action that forces you to reach for your knowledge to
long-term memory. It's not about reading over and over your notes. It's about
trying to talk about it to yourself, trying to reach EVERYTHING you know about this topic
only from your head! During this you can also create open questions that will serve you
for a long time!

Each repetition session increases your awareness about your knowledge and builds 
your motivation!
#### Leave physical effects after your work
1. Notes! Notes! Notes! Notes are "touchable" evidence of completed learning session.
2. Flashcards (digital or physical) are portable way to take knowledge with you.
#### Monitor your plan, progress and effects
We need to feel that we are controlling our learning process. In order to monitor, we
need something to monitor - that is why we need a plan.

Assign chunks of your learning material to particular days in the calendar. DO NOT MOVE IT.
It will be helpful to judge the progress. Remember not to compare yourself with others.
It is not a race, everybody learns in different pace and fact that somebody is learning
faster does not mean he/she will understand the topic better. Sometimes (or even often!)
it is better to slow down in order to achieve deep understanding.

#### Closing chunks during learning
Every chunk of new knowledge, every repetition session, every prepared note is 
a small success. Remember to set small, daily goals EVERYDAY. Completing them will
build your sense of effectiveness. If you plan only one big topic for the whole day
there is big chance that you could not accomplish it. It's better to say that you
completed 8 out of 10 small chunks than you did not finish one big chunk.  
It's also worth to consider if you dedicate enough time for your learning sessions.

### Hygiene of learning
1. Breaks are vital, period. They are compulsory to make your brain sort out new knowledge.
 
    It is also important to remember that learning session on which you learn 50% of the material
is a big success! It is how our brains work. That is why we make repetitions, to change
this 50% to 99%. Forgetting something is natural part of learning process so we have
to have good attitude about it.

2. Sleep. Good sleeping hygiene makes your learning sessions more effective. 
When you sleep your brain is also trying to sort out new knowledge.

### Environment factor - how?
#### Minimising your environment
When you are learning - try to avoid everything that can drag your attention.
Phone - airplane mode, web browser - only learning related tabs, earplugs or headphones 
with quiet music (without lyric!).

Need to communicate with others? Try use shared google document or some other app that is
dedicated to the learning session.

#### Environment help
1. Learning together is double-edged sword. Be careful.  
It is worthy to consider learning in the place where everybody is focused on their job.

2. Ask your close relatives for support - especially those that understand your challenges.
Small thing can be miraculous - make tea, turning down music in another room.

#### Atmosphere during learning
We should try to make learning pleasant. Tidy up your room, sort notes, open windows
for fresh air, learn in your favourite and friendly place. For your learning partners pick
people, who you feel comfortable with.

#### Place to learn
Keep everything you need to learn within the reach to always see what you have done and
what you will have to do.
Try to create your learning place in the way that it will both satisfy 
and do not distract you.

#### Collecting feedback
If you can - collect feedback. If you have a teacher, mentor, colleagues. Try to find out
if you are working in the right direction. Every assurance will increase your motivation
and will serve as award for your well done job.

### Summary 
Set clear and real goals, think out if you have required skills and enough time to do it 
and use your environment to your advantage.
