# Summary

We should not read in order to pass some exam, but to learn something.  
Build motivation, not have it or find it.

There are many factors that can influence our motivation and they fall in three categories:  

### Seeing value
Seeing personal value in accomplishing the goal. It can be feel of 
overall rise of competence, learning something practical and applicable in life or just
to satisfy the curiosity.

### Belief in effectiveness
It is belief that your knowledge level is high enough to understand new part of knowledge.

### Environment factor
All other factors that have direct or indirect impact on our learning sessions.
Not every of them are dependent to us.  
Do we learn alone or in group?  
Do we use quiet place or we use public places?  
Do our surrounding people (partner, parents, friends) encourage us or pull to the bottom?  

Now we can think how to achieve those three categories. 

### Seeing value - how?
1. Find value in both short and long term. What could you do if you knew those things? 
Write it down.
2. Join this task with your plans or dreams. It helps you to become who?
3. Make sure that this thing you want to learn will increase your competences. 
Ask yourself: Will I feel that I learned something new? 
Compare yourself to yourself from yesterday.
4. You can learn something in many different ways. Alone or with someone, 
book or lectures, etc. 

### Belief in effectiveness - how?
In order to increase belief in our effectiveness to learn we can use effective 
learning techniques.
There are couple of groups:  
#### Selection of materials
1. ALWAYS Try to define your level of competence. Do not be afraid. 
In order to draw a road to the goal, you also need to know where you start :)  
By this way you will know how to tackle the problem and there the chance 
that you create an achievable plan will be bigger. And if the material will turn out to
be hard, it will not scare or surprise you - and there will be no decrease of motivation.
2. Check if the materials you want to use to learn are relevant to the goal.
Before you start the learning process - prepare all of the materials. Ask somebody
who is already there if this is a good way.
#### Plan your learning sessions
1. ALWAYS divide your material to smaller chunks. It will be easier to estimate 
the effort and better for your motivation. Try not to finish your learning sessions in the
middle of a chunk.
2. Create a plan based on deadline. Include rest and emergency days - first for rest, 
second for catching up in case of... emergency :P
3. Your plan should include days for repetition. The number of repetition days should 
be at least as big as the number of learning days. Repetitions are vital
4. Do not to change the plan. NEVER... or only if some unexpected random event
 absorbs you for a few days.
#### Systematization and organization of knowledge
1. Create graphical representation of the topic. It can be a diagram, table or mind map.
It will increase your awareness of whole topic and during learning you will see how those
small chunks of knowledge are filling up the diagram.
2. In order to systematize the knowledge you need to test yourself. The best way to do this
is active repetition - so every action that forces you to reach for your knowledge to
long-term memory. It's not about reading over and over your notes. It's about
trying to talk about it to yourself, trying to reach EVERYTHING you know about this topic
only from your head! During this you can also create open questions that will serve you
for a long time!

Each repetition session increases your awareness about your knowledge and builds 
your motivation!
#### Leave physical effects after your work
1. Notes! Notes! Notes! Notes are "touchable" evidence of completed learning session.
2. Flashcards (digital or physical) are portable way to take knowledge with you.
#### Monitor your plan, progress and effects
We need to feel that we are controlling our learning process. In order to monitor, we
need something to monitor - that is why we need a plan.

Assign chunks of your learning material to particular days in the calendar. DO NOT MOVE IT.
It will be helpful to judge the progress. Remember not to compare yourself with others.
It is not a race, everybody learns in different pace and fact that somebody is learning
faster does not mean he/she will understand the topic better. Sometimes (or even often!)
it is better to slow down in order to achieve deep understanding.

#### "Checking todos"
Every 
KaÅ¼de maÅ‚e zadanie odhaczone z powodzeniem w planie pracy, kaÅ¼dy w caÅ‚oÅ›ci 
przerzucony stosik fiszek z danego tematu, 
kaÅ¼dy plik notatek, ktÃ³ry uda Ci siÄ™ od poczÄ…tku do koÅ„ca przerobiÄ‡ â€“ 
jest zakoÅ„czonym etapem. Jest sukcesem samym w sobie. PamiÄ™taj, 
aby codziennie stawiaÄ‡ sobie maÅ‚e, dzienne cele. Ich realizacja 
zbuduje Twoje poczucie skutecznoÅ›ci w dziaÅ‚aniu.

JeÅ›li wyznaczysz sobie tylko jeden duÅ¼y temat na caÅ‚y dzieÅ„, 
istnieje spora szansa, Å¼e nie uda Ci siÄ™ go skoÅ„czyÄ‡. Wtedy 
pozostajesz z uczuciem wstydu i zniechÄ™cenia. JeÅ›li natomiast 
zakoÅ„czysz 8 z 10 jego czÄ™Å›ci, zadziaÅ‚a to zupeÅ‚nie inaczej dziÄ™ki 
poczuciu domkniÄ™cia. OczywiÅ›cie tak samo warto wtedy przemyÅ›leÄ‡, czy 
nie poÅ›wiÄ™camy na naukÄ™ zbyt maÅ‚o czasu i czy nie stworzymy sobie 
zbyt duÅ¼ych zalegÅ‚oÅ›ci. ðŸ™‚
