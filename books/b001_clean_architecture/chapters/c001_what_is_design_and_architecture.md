# Chapter 1. What is design and architecture?

There is no clear division between "architecture" and "design", 
because you can't have one without another and there is no clear
division line that separates it. It's a continuum of decisions from
highest to lowest levels. 
"Little details support high-level decisions"  

The measure of design quality is the measure of effort required to meet
the needs of the customer. 

If effort is low and stays low through lifetime - design is good.  
If effort grows with each release - design is bad.

Number of engineers - increase exponentially, but company productivity 
measured with number of new lines of code is not.
Looking at "cost per line of code" - grows exponentially. NOT GOOD.

Engineers effort stays the same, but it's shifted from features to managing mess.

Look at cost of features at the beginning of product life and at the end. 

### The Tortoise and the Hare

> Slow and steady wins the race.

### Tips

Make "we can clean it up later" a red flag.

### Quotes

> The goal of software architecture is to minimize the human resources required
> to build and maintain the required system.

> The only way to go fast, is to go well.

### Questions    
- What is design?  
- What is architecture?  
- What is difference between two?  
- The Tortoise and the Hare. But we can think and think and think 
slowly about solution - and how can we know that this solution is good?  
- What makes code "well designed"?
- What clean architecture looks like?  
- Which attributes of system architecture lead to clean architecture?
