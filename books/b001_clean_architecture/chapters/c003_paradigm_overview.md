# Chapter 3. Paradigm overview

### Starting with the bricks: Programming paradigms
Today, there are three programming paradigms.

 - Structured programming:  
 Imposes discipline on direct transfer of control.
 - Object-oriented programming:  
 Imposes discipline on indirect transfer of control.
 - Functional programming:  
 Imposes discipline upon assignment.
 
 > Every programming paradigm is imposing restrictions.


It is told there that there are only 3 programming paradigms.
BUT! What about Reactive Programming? Is this a paradigm? Maybe it is not.

What paradigms have to do with architecture? Everything. We use polymorphism
to cross architectural boundaries.
We use functional programming to impose discipline on the location 
of and access to data; and we use structured programming as the
algorithmic foundation of our modules.
