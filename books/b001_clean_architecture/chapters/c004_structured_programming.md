# Structured programming

Firstly, many programmers use goto statements, but later (thanks to Dijkstra) 
they drop this idea.

Structured programming allows modules to be recursively decomposed 
into smaller, provable units. Each of those units can be divided into
smaller funcions, ad infinitum.

> Testing shows the presence, not the absence, of bugs.
