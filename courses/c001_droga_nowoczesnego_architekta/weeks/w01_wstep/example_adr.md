## Title
Choosing language for new project

## Context

Our team starts a new project.   
We need to develop simple microservice that will receive and send SNS messages.  
We were thinking about Java, Kotlin and Python

## Decision
Status: accepted (proposed/accepted/rejected/obsoleted)  
Decision: Java  
Date: 21.07.2020

## Consequences
Java is the main language for most of the developers.
Kotlin could is modern and could be fun to work with, but we need to satisfy deadlines.  
Python has nice SNS libraries, but it is totally different language than Java or Kotlin and is not commonly known in our company.
